# Employee Tracker
    
## Description
This CLI interface allows users to record, manage, manipulate, and track data regarding the names, roles, and departments of their various employees. When this information is managed digitally, it no longer has to create massive paper waste recording the command tree and other organizational information.

This project encourages the use of digital data tracking in the workplace to make employee management more efficient and more easily consumable and connectable
